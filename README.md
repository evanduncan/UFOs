# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a webpage with a customizable table of UFO sighting data. The table was to consist of events fitting given search criteria and it was to update live.

## Results
To use the webpage, you enter information in the text boxes under the "Filter Search" heading. You can enter info in one or a number of the boxes to pull-up all the events fitting your description.

## Summary
One drawback of the webpage currently is that all the city, state, country, and shape fields have values that are all lowercase which can look a bit unprofessional.
Two improvements that could be made are to restructure the "Filter Search" section to remove the bullets next to the search fields and to create borders between the different sections of the webpage.
